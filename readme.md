**Depth Charge** a Ludum Dare 57 project

Oh no! The Dastardly Sub-nation is attackingâ€¦ from the Depths!

Only one man is standing between them and world domination: John Deep and his trusty boat Boaty.

Assist John Deep by indicating where to deploy depth charges and defeat the Dastardly Sub-nation through the innovative Depth Fuze Indicator System (tm pending).

Control where John Deep navigates boaty by hovering the mouse horizontally and how deep the depth charge should detonate by hovering the mouse vertically. Then click to deploy a depth charge. BOMBS AWAY!

Good Luck and Enjoy! Redmori & Stephen!
